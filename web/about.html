              This page is about the development and technical aspects of MyMemoryPalace. If this 
              isn't what you're looking for, you're probably interested in 
              <a href="/learn.html">learning about the technique</a> instead.
            </p>

            <p>
              From a technical perspective, MyMemoryPalace is a combination of a simple Bootstrap
              template and a small application written using Facebook's React.js library. It's my
              first attempt at building anything in React, and as such, I sincerely doubt that I'm
              following anything like best practices. On the other hand, it's been a great learning
              experience, and it's heightened my interest in combining React with the Flux pattern, 
              which is probably my next target.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the subject of Flux, this application has no real persistence layer or server-side
              components at all. The little bit of persistence that is needed is accomplished via 
              Javascript session storage. I had considered going further and allowing for things like
              sign in and multiple palaces and so on, but I realized that before I went too far off the
              deep in on my own, I should probably get my head around Flux so that I could do it the "right"
              way.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a very brief explanation, I know, but if you're really curious how I did everything
              and how it all works, your best bet is to check out the 
              <a href='https://github.com/stlewis/my-memory-palace'>GitHub repo</a> where it
              all lives. Comments and suggestions are always welcome there, and of course, you should feel
              free to clone your own copy and do what you like with this code.
