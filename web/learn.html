              The "method of loci", which is also known by the more familiar terms
              "memory palace" or "mind palace", is a memorization technique that has
              been referenced as far back as the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was 
              extensively studied in the 1960's and 70's, and it is used effectively 
              today by many who compete in "memory competitions" where they are asked
              to memorize sequences of digits, letters, playing cards, or just about
              anything else. In popular culture, the main character of BBC's television
              show "Sherlock" relies upon the memory palace technique to recall various
              obscure bits of information.
            </p>

            <p>
              To the uninitiated, there may appear to be something mysterious or magical
              to the ability to rattle off, in sequence, the contents of a randomly shuffled
              deck of cards, or the names of all of the US presidents in order. As it happens,
              studies have shown that most memory contest champions do not have notably superior
              intelligence or any particular difference in their brain structure or function.
              Their success is attributable purely to the study and application of techniques 
              such as the memory palace, which means that this is something that can be 
              <em>learned</em>, and it doesn't take a genius to do it.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this short article, we'll be exploring the method of loci. What it is, how 
              it works, and how you can use it to improve your own memory. Toward the end,
              I'll talk a little bit about the MyMemoryPalace application, which is a small
              tool I've designed to help you practice the Memory Palace technique.
            </p>

            <h2>The Method</h2>

            <p>
              The Latin word <em>loci</em> means "places", (the singular being <em>locus</em> 
              if you're interested). And it is around the concept of places or locations that
              the method of loci revolves. The basic steps for employing it go as follows:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Choose a place to act as your memory palace.</li>
              <li>Identify specific points within that place to act as <em>locus</em></li>
              <li>Memorize a path through your memory palace that brings you in to contact with each of your <em>loci</em></li>
              <li>When you want to remember something, or a sequence of things, invent a vivid image and "place" that image on or near a <em>locus</em> in your memory palace</li>
              <li>To recall what's on your list, simply "walk" through your palace to each point and "look" at what you put there.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              If the steps above don't clear everything up for you, don't worry, we'll be going through each 
              one in detail.
            </p>

            <h3>Choosing A Place</h3>
            
            <p>
              Perhaps the most crucial step in using the method of loci effectively is choosing the
              right location for your memory palace. They key is to make sure that it is a place that
              you are very familiar with. You need to be able to close your eyes and really visualize
              it in good detail. You need to be able to imagine walking through it in your mind. If 
              your memory of a place is fuzzy or lacking in detail, then it probably wouldn't make a 
              good memory palace. For obvious reasons, most people that employ this method will use 
              locations like their home or workplace as memory palaces.
            </p>

            <h3>Identifying Loci</h3>

            <p>
              Once you're sure of the place you're going to use for your palace, the next step is 
              deciding what your <em>loci</em> will be. Your loci should be the specific parts of
              your memory palace that stand out in your mind. For instance, if you're using your
              home as your memory palace, things like the dining room table, the kitchen sink or 
              the bed in your bedroom might make good <em>loci</em>. Much like the criteria for
              choosing your memory palace in the first place, the most important thing about the
              <em>loci</em> you choose is that you can vividly recall it and imagine yourself
              walking past it or interacting with it in your memory palace.
            </p>

            <h3>Memorizing a Path</h3>

            <p>
              After you've established what your <em>loci</em> are going to be, you need to 
              get in the habit of "visiting" each one. The most effective way to do this is 
              to imagine yourself walking through your memory palace, and to practice taking
              this "walk" in the same way, every time. Your walk will need to take you past
              each of the loci you identified in the step above. As you get better with the
              technique, it will become less important that you do the walk in order, (unless
              what you're trying to remember must be remembered in sequence), but especially
              when you're just starting out, deciding upon and comitting to a specific path
              will help your recall.
            </p>

            <h3>Placing Items</h3>

            <p>
              The steps above are all about <em>establishing</em> your memory palace. Once
              you've done so, you're going to want to use it to remember things. That's where
              this step comes in. Given some list of things to remember, "placing items" in
              your memory palace means visiting each of your <em>loci</em> in turn, and inventing
              a particularly vivid image that reminds you of the item you are trying to remember.
              Once you have that image, imagine it existing on, in or near the <em>locus</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It takes a bit of imagination to come up with sufficiently vivid imagery to use
              in your memory palace, but you'll improve with practice. One helpful tip is to 
              try to consistently use the same image for things you commonly need to remember.
              For instance, if you associate the number 2 with a pair of dice showing snake 
              eyes, <em>always</em> use the visual of the dice when you need to remember the
              number 2. Another thing to keep in mind is that the more outlandish or out of 
              place a particular image is, the more likely you are to remember it.
            </p>

            <h3>Recalling Items</h3>

            <p>
              If you've followed all of the steps above, you'll probably find that your recall
              improves pretty dramatically with very little practice. The method for recalling
              an item you've memorized using this method is simply to "walk" back through your
              memory palace, and "look" at each of your <em>loci</em> in turn. You might be 
              surprised to discover how quickly the "hint" image you imagined there will pop
              in to your brain. If your hint was effective, you should easily recall the thing
              you're trying to remember.
            </p>

            <p>
              Have you tried this out, and surprised yourself with how effective it is? Read on 
              to discover <em>how</em> the method of loci works.
            </p>

            <h2>How and Why It Works</h2>

            <p>
              The effectiveness of the method of loci is grounded in the fact that human beings
              have particularly good <em>spatial memory</em>, and a great capacity for imagination
              and visualization. To put that another way, we're very good at remembering things like
              the layout of a building or how to get from one point to another based on our environment
              and surroundings, and we're able to construct visual "images" of things in our brains.
            </p>

            <p>
              As it happens, most people's spatial memory is <em>far</em> better than their ability to
              remember things in abstract, like arbitrary lists of items or historical facts. The method
              of loci works by causing your mind to leverage it's <em>spatial</em> memory and capacity
              for creating mental images when trying to remember arbitary things. By taking some piece
              of data, giving it a "concrete" visual form, and associating that data with a location 
              we are very familiar with, we're using a very well-developed part of our brains to help with 
              ordinary recall.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can compare the method of loci with another popular memorization technique -- that is, 
              the use of mnemonics. A menemonic is a "memory cheat", something easily remembered that
              serves to remind you of something that's harder to remember. For instance, a popular
              mnemonic for remembering the "lines" of the treble clef in music is the sentence, 
              "Every good boy does fine". By taking the first letter of each word in this sentence,
              you get the letters corresponding to each line of the treble clef, starting at the bottom
              and going up. The sentence is easy to remember, as is the rule to take the first letter
              from each word. Another popular mnemonic is to use the knuckles of one hand to recall
              the number of days in each month. Starting on your index knuckle, list off the names
              of each month as you touch your knuckles and the spaces between them, until you reach
              the name of the month you're interested in. If you landed on a knuckle, that month has 
              31 days. If you landed on a gap between two knuckles, that day has at most 30 days, (an
              allowance has to be made for February, because February is contrary).
            </p>

            <p>
              So again, mnemonics are easily remembered ideas, concepts, or rules, which are associated
              with more complex things. In the method of loci, the traditional mnemonic is replaced by
              a vivid <em>image</em>, which serves the same purpose -- providing an association between
              the the easily recalled thing, and something more complex or more abstract. The further 
              idea of "putting" that vivid image within the context of a place you are familar with 
              removes the need to remember another "abstract" thing, (such as a particular mnemonic
              sentence...I can never quite recall the mnemonic for remembering the planets in our 
              solar system).
            </p>

            <p>
              This brief explanation barely scratches the surface of the psychology and science behind
              the method of loci, and I'd encourage you to do your own research and look deeper if this
              is a topic that interests you. For the moment, we'll move on to the MyMemoryPalace application
              and how it can help you develop and perfect the memory palace technique.
            </p>

            <h2>Using MyMemoryPalace</h2>

            <p>
              When I first started trying to use the memory palace technique myself, I was thrilled to see
              that it really did work. I realized though, that while it is pretty easy to <em>explain</em> the
              method, becoming really accomplished with it was going to take some work. There were a couple
              of challenges that I noticed right away.  The first was that while I had a very clear image in
              my head of my palace itself, I was having some difficulty recalling each of my <em>loci</em> and
              remembering the order to visit them in, (that is, the path I needed to walk through my palace).
            </p>

            <p>
              In theory, you should be able to remember a number of items equal to or less than the number
              of <em>loci</em> you have in your memory palace. However, if you're having trouble clearly visualizing
              your "walk" through your palace, or remembering which points in it are <em>loci</em>, you're going
              to miss things.
            </p>

            <p>
              The MyMemoryPalace application is meant to help you practice that aspect of the memory palace 
              technique. It allows you to "create" a memory palace by giving it a name and associating any
              number of <em>locus</em> with it. Once that's done, the application will let you practice the
              technique. However rather than giving you a list of things to remember and a blank page, the
              application will prompt you by reminding you which <em>locus</em> you should be looking at as
              you progress through your palace. After some work, you'll find that you no longer need the
              reminder, and your "walk" through your palace will bring you naturally in to contact with each
              of your <em>loci</em>. It's really that simple.
            </p>

            <p>
              It might be worth mentioning here that the entire MyMemoryPalace application was started as a 
              technical experiment in using React.js and simple HTML/Javascript, and it's primary purpose for
              existing is to highlight my work in those areas. If you're interested in learning more about 
              the technical aspects of the application, you should take a look at
