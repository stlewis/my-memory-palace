            <h2>The Technique</h2>
            <p>
            The method of loci, (also called the Memory Palace or Mind Palace), 
            is a method of memory enhancement that combines visualization techniques with 
            the power of our spatial memory. Another way to say that is that it allows us
            to use our imagination, along with our familiarity the places that
            we've been, to increase our ability to remember things. 
            </p>

             <p>
              The technique is very easy to learn, and so intuitive that, depending on how good 
              you are at visualization, you might begin to see a dramatic improvement in your memory
              as soon as you start trying it. This short article will explain the basics of the
              method of loci, and set you on your way to being able to use it.
             </p>

             <h3>Building Your Palace</h3>

             <p>
                The "memory palace" technique gets it's name from the fact that in order to use it, 
                you'll need to be able to clearly visualize a specific place. This place becomes your
                "memory palace". It can be real, or entirely imagined. The only criteria are that you be
                able to see it perfectly clearly in your mind, and that you are able to "move through" it
                in your imagination.
             </p>

             <p>
                This need for extreme familiarty leads most people to use real locations such as their
                home or office as their memory palace. Another popular choice is to use their memory of 
                an often repeated commute, (such as to work). This can be an especially powerful one, as 
                it is often long enough to include many loci, (we'll explain that in a moment), and the "movement"
                is already built in to your memory of it.
             </p>

             <p>
                Whatever location, real or imagined, that you choose, the next step is to plan a path through your
                palace. If you chose a commute as your memory palace, this is going to be easier since your path
                through it is determined by the route you drive. On the other hand, there are advantages to choosing
                a fixed location as your memory palace, and it is with a fixed location that I recommend you begin. 
                Planning a path is really as simple as visualizing yourself walking through whatever location you've 
                chosen. The most important thing is that you choose <em>one route</em> through, and stick to that 
                route. Before moving on, you should do a few "walkthroughs" of your memory palace, just to make sure
                you're comfortable with the path through it that you've chosen.
             </p>

             <p>
                After you're comfortable with your route, you should begin to notice that certain locations in your
                memory palace stand out. If your memory palace is your house, you might especially notice passing
                the dining room table, or the couch in the living room, for instance. When you're in the bedroom, you're
                probably clearly visualizing your bed or your dresser. These stand out locations are your "loci"...they
                are the places within your memory palace that stick out in your memory. The method of loci is all
                about taking advantage of these locations, so a good next step might be to write down all the loci
                you come across as you walk through your palace in your mind. The more you have, the better, but you 
                should be sure to only note those locations that <em>really</em> stick out in your mind...the places
                that really draw your notice. If you find your mind's eye sliding right past the stove in your kitchen,
                that probably isn't a good candidate for a memory location.
             </p>

             <p>
                So that's it, really. Once you have a location, a path through that location, and a collection of
                "loci" that really stand out as you walk along your route, you've done all you need to in order to 
                build your memory palace. The next step, is to use it.
             </p>

             <h3>Using Your Palace</h3>
             <p>
                If you can clearly visualize your memory palace, and can "walk" along your path, visiting each
                of your loci in turn, then you're already 99% of the way to being able to use your palace as a 
                memory aid. The final step takes the most imagination, but it is also the most fun. The trick itself
                is quite simple. Given a list of things to remember, simply walk through your memory palace in your
                mind, and visualize "hints", at each of your loci.
             </p>

             <p>
                This may be easier to explain with an example. Let's say I have a shopping list with five items 
                on it that I want to remember. Now, five items isn't a whole lot, but the technique is the same
                regardless of how many items you want to remember. In any case, let's say our list looks like this:
             </p>

             <ol>
               <li>Milk</li>
               <li>Eggs</li>
               <li>Butter</li>
               <li>Cheese</li>
               <li>Bread</li>
             </ol>

             <p>
              Now, let's imagine that I'm using my house as my memory palace. If I start at my front door, I pass
              a <em>sidetable</em>, then my <em>dining room table</em>, then a <em>buffet</em>, before I pass in
              to the kitchen. In the kitchen, I'm standing right next to the <em>center island</em> which I walk around
              to reach the <em>stove</em>. My actual memory palace is much larger than this, but I only have five
              items on my list, so I only need five loci. That's a key thing to remember. Whatever the length of the
              list of things you want to remember, you need at least that many loci in your memory palace. For this 
              shopping list, I need at least 5. To remember the names of all the presidents, I'd need 45.
             </p>

             <p>
              Anyway, we have our list, and I have a bunch of loci that I pass by on my walkthrough of my 
              memory palace. The next step is to "place" a hint for each item on the list at a loci in my
              memory palace. For instance...my first list item is milk. I might imagine a cow standing
              right next to my sidetable. For eggs, I might think of a chicken roosting on my dining room
              table, or I could make it relatively simple and imagine a bunch of colorful easter eggs on 
              the dining room table. I might envision a tub of butter, (or a bowl of butterscotch candies), sitting
              on the buffet. A mouse eating cheese on the center island, and a burnt loaf of bread on the stove.
             </p>

             <p>
              You should see the pattern by now. One of the most important pieces of advice for using this method 
              is to make the images you create as outlandish and creative as possible. The more strange or out of
              place the image you invent, the more likely it is to stick in your head and be easier to recall. For
              instance, a chicken roosting on my dining room table is out of the ordinary. On the other hand, if I
              lived on a farm with chickens, imaginging a chicken in my hen house might not really stand out enough.
              Another thing to keep in mind that goes hand in hand with the first piece of advice is that it is 
              better to leave <em>hints</em> about the thing you're trying to remember, rather than just putting the 
              thing itself in your visualization. When you're trying to remember a list of <em>things</em>, just
              envisioning those things may seem like the easiest course, but when you start trying to remember
              abstract concepts, (imagine a list like "lightning", "love", "happiness", "pity"), you'll find that
              "object placement" doesn't quite cut it. Instead, just come up with a weird image that reminds you
              of the thing you have to remember, (a big hole in the ground seems like a good option for "pity", for 
              example, because "pity" is sort of reminicient of the word "pit").
             </p>

             <p>
              Now that you've got the items in your list assigned a visualization and a place in your memory palace,
              recalling those items is as simple as "visiting" the location in your mind, and remembering the hint you
              put there. Your brain's powerful ability to create strong spatial memories will kick in and help you 
              associate the location with the image and the image with the thing you're trying to recall. At first, 
              you're best off sticking to your "route", but as you become more and more familiar with your memory palace
              and start using it, you'll find it's pretty easy to walk it in reverse, or even to "visit", locations out
              of order and see what you have stored there. 
             </p>

             <p>
              Give it a try now, and I'll bet you surprise yourself. Put together a list of 10 random things, and 
              use the memory palace technique to store them in your memory. Try giving yourself only a minute or so
              to "place" the items on the list. Then, try walking through your memory palace and remembering everything
              on your list. How did you do? Do you think you could do the list backwards? How about completely out of
              order? Try testing yourself <em>without</em> using your memory palace. Did you do better or worse?
             </p>

             <h2>Using MyMemoryPalace</h2>

             <p>
              If you've read this far, hopefully you're pretty sold on the idea of using a memory palace to help
              your recall. However, if you're like me, or others I've talked to, one of the hardest parts about
              effectively using a memory palace is <em>really</em> sticking that image of your palace in your head 
              and being able to clearly visualize all of your loci.  When I first started practicing the method of
              loci, I found that I was pretty good at seeing my palace, and pretty good at walking through it, but
              I had a tendency to forget to "check" some of the loci I had chosen along my route.
             </p>

             <p>
              Now, part of fixing that comes down to the advice I gave in the section above. Make sure that you're
              choosing the things in your memory palace that really stand out in your mind as loci. If you're 
              constantly forgetting a particular loci that you've chosen, maybe you should discard it. On the other
              hand, getting your loci fixed in your mind is just like getting your "route" fixed in your mind. It 
              takes practice.
             </p>

             <p>
              That's where this tool comes in. It's a small app that lets you "build" your memory palace by listing
              all of your loci in order. Once you've got your loci in, you can "fill" them with the items you want
              to remember. Finally, you can test yourself, but instead of just being asked to recall your list, you
              will be prompted by being told which loci you need to recall. Again, this process is done in order, so 
              you will reinforce not only <em>what</em> your loci are, but also, the order they appear in, and therefore,
              the route you take through your palace.
             </p>

             <p>
              It's that easy, and I hope that this technique, and this tool help you master your memory!
             </p>
